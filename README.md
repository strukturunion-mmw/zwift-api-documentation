This UNOFFICIAL documentation of the ZWIFT mobile API is the result of what we have collected from existing projects and from our own observations, watching the ZWIFT website and companion app *in action*. It likely is by no means complete nor adorsed or supported by ZWIFT. No guarantees for any functionality are given as ZWIFT may change it's API at any time without notice.  

Please SHARE your insights on the API with us, so the documentation can be completed over time.  

Special thanks go out to the following projects for the groundwork laid:  
- [Ogadai/zwift-mobile-api](https://github.com/Ogadai/zwift-mobile-api)
- [darenc/zwift-php](https://github.com/darenc/zwift-php)
- [jeroni7100/zh-zml](https://github.com/jeroni7100/zh-zml)
- [zwift-client](https://pypi.org/project/zwift-client/)

Ride on!
